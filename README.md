# Week 2 challenge homework

(1) Most elements of my webpage come from the mockup of gif file

(2) I changed some colors and modified some feature to make sure that all colors are suitable.

(3) Since a beginner, I don\`t have enough projects to display. I used some projects/reports that I did before. 

(4) Same reason as previous, I used first week homework and "Run Buddy" project to display as mine.

(5) The names of classes in HTML and CSS are little bit confusion. I tried to make them readability and intelligibility.
